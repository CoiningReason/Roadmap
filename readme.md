# Coining Reason: A Roadmap

> It is the framework which changes with each new technology and not just the picture within the frame. <br>
> —Marshall McLuhan

## Summary

The Coining Reason discussion series focuses each week on blockchain issues through a text or set of texts related to a particular subject area. Below is a rough roadmap of subject areas ("Units"), as well as potential reading lists for each. 

The first session, "Cypherpunk," has readings set and avaialable at the links below. Future sessions' readings will be made available through the Neta DAO Discord server.

Coining Reason's participants will ultimately determine the pace, scale, and direction of these discussions and can modify or depart from this roadmap, which is intended only to indicate where discussion could go.
