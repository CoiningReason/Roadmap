# Coining Reason: A Roadmap


> The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.... I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas. <br>
> —John Maynard Keynes
>
> Disciplinary boundaries allow counterevidence to belong to someone else's story. Reasonable enough. But such arguments are a way of avoiding the awkward truth that if certain constellations of facts are able to enter scholarly consciousness deeply enough, they threaten not only the venerable narratives, but also the entrenched academic disciplines that (re)produce them. <br>
> —Susan Buck-Morss
>
> It is the framework which changes with each new technology and not just the picture within the frame. <br>
> —Marshall McLuhan


## Summary

The Coining Reason weekly discussion series explores ideas related to Web 3 through a set of texts within particular subject areas. The breadth of the selected subject areas, far from undisciplined indulgence, reflects an urgent necessity: financialization means practically all aspects of life are now subsumed by the rule and roil of coin, so that any single disciplinary approach is apt to miss or misrecognize those "constellations of facts" that index more potent realities. A Roadmap of these subject areas (called "Units"), with potential reading lists for each, is included below. Because of the varied depth and extensibility of these Units, Coining Reason's participants will ultimately help determine the pace, scale, and scope of these investigations.

The Schedule will be updated weekly to show the selected readings. Note the first session, "Session 0. Cypherpunks," has already been set. Readings not published online will be made available on the [Neta DAO Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gvjC86WXC2).

## Roadmap

### Unit I: The Internet


Before thinking about Web 3, it may be helpful to come to terms with the histories of Web 2 and Web 1 and the broader impact of telecommunications technologies. We will canvas these issues by centering a single question: What is a human being---or what is human nature---such that it develops these technologies of distance and propinquity, acquires prostheses of talk and touch? By elaborating what we seek in these tele-technologies we will be better poised to evaluate what they offer.

### Unit II: Economics



Before all the talk of "Web 3," there was Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is as much an intervention in digital technology as it is in monetary theory. In this Unit, we will present histories and theories of the "money" concept, as well as strive to ascertain a relation between money and surplus value. The economic problem of surplus value will be brought into connection with human nature's surplus of virtuality as explored in Unit I.

Human beings believe—--and we _want_ to believe. What does money make it possible for us to believe, and what does belief make it possible (or impossible) for us to think about money?
